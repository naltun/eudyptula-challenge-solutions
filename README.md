# Eudyptula Challenge

## Solutions

You will find my solutions to [The Eudyptula Challenge](http://eudyptula-challenge.org/).

The Eudyptula Chllange is a set of tasks used to teach the student how to hack onto the Linux kernel.

All solutions are in the public domain.

NOTE: The Eudyptula Challenge is on an acceptance basis; that is, every user who signs up must wait
to be entered into the program. The tasks, however, are publicly available [here](https://github.com/agelastic/eudyptula).

This way, I can complete the challenge without actually taking part in the program.
